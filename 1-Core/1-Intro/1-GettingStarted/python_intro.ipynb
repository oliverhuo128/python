    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Made by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that emphasises code readability that consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages for beginners and professionals alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can you do with Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Data visualisation\n",
    "  - Example [Uber Ridesharing in NYC Visualisation built with Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/main)\n",
    "  - See the [streamlit gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery) for more examples, although you can create visualisation dashboards with many other librarires.\n",
    "- Statistics and machine learning\n",
    "- Web development\n",
    "    - Built with django web framework: [The National Geographic website](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/)\n",
    "- Automation or scripting of everyday tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has simple syntax that mimics natural language\n",
    "  - This makes Python **beginner-friendly** and easy to read.\n",
    "- Its open source\n",
    "  - This means Python is free to use, built and supported by the developer community, without any corporate interest.\n",
    "- It has a large and active online community supporting and extending Python to suit many usecases\n",
    "  - This makes Python a very stable language.\n",
    "  - This makes Python very **versatile** (Python has a large array of useful modules and libraries that add functionality)\n",
    "  - This also makes it very **easy to find support** for learning and for troubleshooting online.\n",
    "  - Python is a **popular**, **in-demand** professional skill.\n",
    "- Python is a **high-level** language\n",
    "  - This combined with its simple syntax means that it takes less code to make big projects a reality.\n",
    "  - Althought this can come at the cost of performance for certain tasks\n",
    "- Python is a **multi-paradigm** language\n",
    "  - This means you have the ability to code in multiple ways and doesn't box you into one programming paradigm.\n",
