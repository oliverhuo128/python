# Getting Started

Python is a powerful, user-friendly programming language, used in a wide range of application environments. 
In this learning unit, we will install the Anaconda distribution, 
which is well suited to data science, data engineering, and many aspects of machine learning.  

You can locate the official download site by searching for Anaconda Distribution, 
and selecting the Windows install options for the Individual Edition. 
We're assuming that you have a computer running Windows 10 or later, 
at least 10 GB of spare disk space, and for the download, a good internet connection. 

Running the installer should be straightforward:
- We recommend installing under your username, rather than as administrator. 
- There is one departure from the default installation that we suggest: 
you will be offered a choice of adding the Python folder to the system PATH environment variable. 
By default, this is set to 'No': we suggest that you change this to 'Yes'. 

At the end of the installation, try launching the 'Anaconda Navigator' app, 
by hitting the windows key and typing this name. 
This gives you the choice of several Python programming applications and utilities. 

These include:
- Anaconda prompt:  the command prompt, with Python commands added in.  
- Jupyter Notebooks: an application that uses your browser for editing and running Python notebooks 
- Spyder: for writing and organising Python applications. 
This includes tools for managing versions of your source files, and for ‘debugging’ the applications you are writing: 
that means monitoring the state of your application, while it is running.

To informally check that your installation is successful, click the launch button for the `anaconda prompt`, 
and type `python –help`, and then hit the 'return' (or 'enter')  key on the right of your keyboard. 
Note that lower case letters are used. If you see the official manual page for Python, then congratulations! 
It would appear that you have a working Python installation at your disposal.
