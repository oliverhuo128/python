This is because lambda functions guarantee that there are 'no side effects', meaning that they are easier to deploy onto this architecture (because there will be more flexibility about which data can be processed first).\n","\n","But there are also some disadvantages:\n","- If the same anonymous lambda function is used in two different places, then this means code is duplicated. Code duplications are a common source of bugs, since there's a chance that one or more copies of the code will be missed out, when the code is updated. If the same function is used more than once, it's probably better to give it a name.\n","- Some things are hard to write as a single expression. For example, an `if`...`elif`... `else` block requires a complicated nested construction, to get it into a single expression. In this case it's also best to write it simply as a named expression.\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
