    "- __Attributes__ are variables, which store data. There are 2 types of attributes:\n",
    "    - __Instance Attribute__ - a variable, storing data, specific to a given instance of a Class. When we create a Class Instance (object), all of its unique features will be stored as instance attributes! Those attributes are accessible only by this single instance!\n",
    "    - __Class Attribute__ - a variable, storing data, specific to a given Class itself. It is shared across all instances (objects) of the Class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Think of human kind as a Class in Python. Each person on the Earth is an Instance of the 'Human Kind' Class. All instances, i.e. all people share certain human features, which differentiate us from other 'Classes' in the world - our __consciousness__ is one example. In Python terms, __consciousness__ is a __Class Attribute__! However, each person has unique features, making us all different from one another - e.g. each person has a different __personality__, __virtues__, __ethic__, __eye colour__, __voice__, etc. In Python, these are calles __Instance Attributes__!\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Methods__ are functions, bound/inherent to instances of a Class. There are 2 types of methods:\n",
    "    - __Instance Method__ - a function, bound to Class instances. It can access both instance and class attributes. \n",
    "    - __Class Method__ - a function, bound to the Class itself. It can only access class attributes.\n",
    "    - __Static Method__ - a function which does NOT access or perform logical operations on either instance or class attributes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Again, think of human kind as a Class in Python. Our behaviour and everything we do is an example of a __method__! When we perfom an action - e.g. __think__, __speak__, __help others__, we are calling our __methods__! These are all examples of functions, bound to us as instances of the 'Human Kind' Class! The difference between __Instance__ and __Class Methods__ is in the details, but as long as you remember that methods are simply functions, specific to a certain Class, you are on the right track!! "
