Polymorphism, Duck Typing and Dynamic Binding \n","---\n","Polymorphism, Duck Typing and Dynamic Binding are three closely related ideas that are extensively (and elegantly!) used by Python.\n","\n","## 2.1 Polymorphism\n","\n","'Polymorphism' describes the ability to assign a different meaning or usage to something, in different different contexts. Most frequently, by 'something' we mean a function, or a method. \n","\n","Python uses polymorphism extensively. Here are two examples:\n","\n","### The `+` Operator\n","\n","The `+` operator is polymorphic, in that it provides a single interface to entities of different types, and this gives a different meaning and usage, depending on the context:\n","```\n","print(2 + 2)    # prints '4': integer arithemetic\n","print('2'+'2')  # prints '22': string concatenation \n","```\n","This works because both `int` and `str` classes have `__add__` instance methods. Hence, the `__add__` method is a single interface that provides different usage, in different contexts \n","\n","### The `str` Function\n","\n","The `str` function also uses a single interface to entities of different types, to give polymorphic behaviour. \n","\n","```\n","a = 'hello'; b = 42\n","print([a,b]) # prints square brackets, the value of a in quotes, the value of b not in quotes\n","print(a)     #prints value of a, not in quotes\n","```\n","The first print statement uses quotes for the string, the second print statement doesn't. \n","This is because both `list` and `str` classes both have  `__str__` instance methods, but these provide different behaviour:\n","- The `list` class provides a `__str__` interface that puts string elements in quotes, to make these clearer to read.\n","- The `str` class provides a `__str__` interface that doesn't put its value in quotes, because that would be confusing!\n","\n","Hence, the `__add__` method is a single interface that provides different usage, in different contexts \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["['hello', 42]\n","hello\n"]}],"source":["a = \"hello\"\n","b = 42\n","print([a, b])\n","print(a)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Concept Check: Implementing to a Common Interface\n","\n","Add `__str__` and `__add__` methods to the `Dog` class.
