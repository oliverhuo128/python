# An Introduction to Web APIs

Web APIs are a key concept that we encounter throughout all of the data and software world. Using and building APIs are some of the most useful tools in your data toolkit.

## What is an API?

API = Application Programming Interface

- Disambiguation: APIs in general are a set of rules defining how computers or software should communicate with each other. In this context, we are specifically referring to a web API, which is just a set of rules defining how computers talk to each other over a network like the internet.
- Using a web API is exactly like interacting with a website, but you can programmatically access the data and resources of a website without having to click the front end components and buttons.
- Most APIs are RESTful
  - A  RESTful API organize data entities or resources onto unique URIs

## When might you want to use an API?

- Querying, modifying, and maintaining a persistent storage layer.
- Running a complex process.
- Performing an action on your behalf that only they are allowed to do.
